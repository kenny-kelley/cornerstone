# BigCommerce's Cornerstone theme

I forked this repo from BigCommerce to do some test development for Philmont Scout Ranch's Tooth of Time Traders online store in February 2021.

You can find the actual live store here: https://store.philmontscoutranch.org/

The idea is to implement an ordering form allowing for puchase of multiple variants of a single product. I'm roughly following the walkthrough found here: https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/build-a-bulk-order-form-for-bigcommerce-product-variants-4bf88ada05fb
